# CivicConnect Pitch Script (3 Minutes)

**Speaker 1 (The Problem):**
"Good morning judges. Meet Ramesh. Last month, a deep pothole appeared outside his shop in Ranchi. He called the helpline – no answer. He visited the municipal office – they asked for a written application. 30 days later, the pothole is still there, now bigger. 
This is the story of every Indian city. Citizens feel unheard, and officials are overwhelmed by paper trails and 1000s of unverified complaints."

**Speaker 2 (The Solution):**
"Enter **CivicConnect**. A unified, intelligent platform that bridges this gap instantly.
With our Mobile App, Ramesh just takes a photo. That's it.
Our **AI Engine** instantly verifies: 'Yes, this is a pothole' and rejects spam.
Our **Geo-Routing System** identifies it's Ward 4, and auto-assigns it to the Junior Engineer responsible for that specific road."

**Speaker 1 (The Tech Stack):**
"We didn't just build a form. We built a system.
- **Flutter** Mobile App for citizens.
- **Node.js & PostGIS** backend for geospatial intelligence.
- **Python AI** service for image classification.
- **React** Dashboard for the Command Center."

**Speaker 2 (The Impact):**
"In our pilot simulation, we reduced the reporting time from 4 hours to 30 seconds.
By grouping complaints via Geofencing, we save fuel for municipal trucks.
This is Clean & Green technology in action. Sustainable, Scalable, and Smart."

**Both:**
"CivicConnect. Empowering Citizens, Enabling Governance."
